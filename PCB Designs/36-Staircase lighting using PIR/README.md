   <p>The following is an attempt to interface PIR or Passive Infrared sensor with a Bulb indicating an automatic staircase lighting system where we detect any movement with the help of PIR sensor and accordingly glow the Bulb while no glow would be observed when no movement is detected. In the PCB you'll find a two pin component wherein a light bulb can be supported.<br><br>Here are some of the visuals of PCB designed<br>
        
   Have Fun !
