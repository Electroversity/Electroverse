   <p>Here the transistor acts as a switch for glowing the led and the NPN transistor used here is controlled by the current. A negative-positive-negative transistor is denoted by the abbreviation NPN. A p-type semiconductor is fused between two n-type semiconductor materials in this configuration.
  <br><br>Here are some of the visuals of PCB designed<br>
