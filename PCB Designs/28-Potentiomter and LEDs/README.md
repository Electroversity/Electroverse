   <p>Following is an implementation of the program to display an opposite effect on Leds with a potentiometer control over them. Now by opposite effect we mean to display that when potentiometer reaches maximum value one of the led glows while the other dims out completely.
  <br><br>Here are some of the visuals of PCB designed<br>
        
   Have Fun !
