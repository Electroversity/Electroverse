   <p>Here, we deal with using IR or infrared sensor and interfacing it with leds using IR remote. An IR sensor is an electronic device that measures and detects the Infrared Radiations for which we have made a printed circuit board.<br><br>Here are some of the visuals of PCB designed<br>
        
   Have Fun !
