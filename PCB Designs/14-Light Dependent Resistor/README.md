   <p>An LDR or a photo resistor is a photo conductive sensor. It is a variable resistor that changes it's resistance in a proportion to the light exposed to it. It's resistance decreases with the intensity of light. We use 'analogRead' to get the values where terminal 2 of the LDR is connected to ground via resistor and also connected to the analog pin.
