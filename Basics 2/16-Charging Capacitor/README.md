    <p>Here, we deal with using IR or infrared sensor and interfacing it with leds using IR remote. An <i>IR sensor is an electronic device that measures and detects the Infrared Radiations</i>.<br>The IR remote is a wireless device acting as a transmitter that carries signals from remote to the devices it controls. It emits lights in an IR range that corresponds to specific commands.</p>
