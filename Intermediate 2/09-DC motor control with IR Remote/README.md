<h1>Obstacle Avoidance robot using 2 Gear Motors</h1>

<div>
   <p>Following is an attempt to create the Obstacle Avoiding robot using 2 gear motors. The front distance is being measured by the ultrasonic sensor.</p>
  
  >Note: We aren't using a servo motor to measure the right and left distance here

  <h3>Components Required</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>1x LCD Display</li>
    <li>4x Resistor 220Î©</li>
    <li>HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor</li>
    <li>2x gear motors</li>
    <li>1x L293D motor driver</li>
    <li>Jumper Wires</li>
    <li>Arduino UNO</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Some key points to look out for</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The circuit comprises of 4 different colour leds to let the user know what the robot is about to do be it move forward, backward, right or left</li>
    <li>Here we haven't used a servo motor so the robot will be always measuring the distance to an obstacle in front of it.</li>
    <li>The two gear motors are being controlled via the motor driver which is present since it can support max 2 motors.</li>
    <li>If you wish to build a 4 gear motor robot then make sure to use another motor drive for the control of the 2 new gear motors.</li>
  </ul><br>
