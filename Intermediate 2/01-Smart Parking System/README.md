<h1>Smart Parking System</h1>

<div>
    <p> In this project we use Ultrasonic Distance sensors to check if the parking space is empty or full and displays about it on the LCD screen.
    <br><br>
        If the vehicle (the object in TinkerCAD) is in proximity of the sensor it will detect it and recognizes the space as full.
        All the sensors report this to the Arduino and according to it the parking space (if available) is displayed.
        This project can be further extended to include much more sensors using multiplexers to deploy as a full scale product.

  Have Fun !</p>
