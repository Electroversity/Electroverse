## Contributing to Electroverse 👋

Hey! We are assuming that you are excited to contribute to this repository. Thankyou for investing your time to contribute to this community driven repository.

## 💡 Let's Contribute

**New implementation is welcome!** Please check whether the circuit has already been implemented to a problem in the [DIRECTORY.md](https://github.com/Electroversity/Electroverse/blob/main/DIRECTORY.md), according to which you can submit a valid pull request. 

As of 1st July, 2022, we have categorised the repository into 5 sections. Below you can see their respective name and role:
- [Basics 1](https://github.com/Electroversity/Electroverse/tree/main/Basics%201) $\rightarrow$ _The circuits deal with interfacing individual electrical components with Arduino._
- [Basics 2](https://github.com/Electroversity/Electroverse/tree/main/Basics%202) $\rightarrow$ _Interfacing 2 or more simple electrical components with Arduino_
- [Intermediate 1](https://github.com/Electroversity/Electroverse/tree/main/Intermediate%201) $\rightarrow$ _Relatively simple systems compared to Intermediate 2_
- [Intermediate 2](https://github.com/Electroversity/Electroverse/tree/main/Intermediate%202) $\rightarrow$ _Good looking Systems_
- [PCB Designs](https://github.com/Electroversity/Electroverse/tree/main/PCB%20Designs) $\rightarrow$ _Implementation of PCB designs for the circuits present in all the above folders_

**Improving comments** and writing **proper documentation** are also highly welcome.

## 🚦 Quickstart

⚡ We wanted this repository to be beginner friendly, so it would be very helpful if the contributors could contribute in the mentioned standard:
- **Use Images/GIF** wherever possible, either to display the working or the output.
- Lay out a **really nice documentation** for the readers.
- Make sure to point to the important files for implementation.
- Adding valid comments to the code wherever required would be super helpful.
- If you have referred/learnt from some external link, mention them as well.
