<h1>V-I Characteristics of Zener Diode</h1>

<div>
    <img width=600 align=right src="">
    <p>One of the most basic circuits of a zener diode is its connection with a resistor. The zener diode provides the reference voltage, but a series resistor must be in place to limit the current into the diode otherwise a large amount of current will flow through it and it could be destroyed.<br><br>
    Take the case where a zener diode circuit is used to supply a regulated 5.1 volt from an input voltage supply of 12 volts.<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Voltage across zener is 5.56V and across resistor is 6.44V</li>
        <li>Current across each element is observed to be 5A</li>
        <li>A zener diode allows current to flow when a certain voltage is reached.</li>
    </ol>
