<h1>Function Generator with Oscilloscope</h1>
<p>Loosen Up a bit because this is not another electric circuit implementation since it's easy and we'll brush up some old wave properties.</p>

    <p>We have studied that frequency is inversely proportional to the time period. So as frequency rises the time period becomes less and vice versa</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Amplitude—distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement of the wave</li>
        <li>Frequency—number of waves passing by a specific point per second</li>
        <li>Period—time it takes for one wave cycle to complete</li>
        <li>Speed of propagation vw is the distance the wave travels in a given time</li>
    </ul>
