    <p>A servo is an actuator that rotates to a precise angle through command. The servo example included in this rotates between 0 to 180 degree. It can move to any angle between 0 to 180 degrees.<br><br>
      A servo receives the command from the arduino, moves the commanded angle and stops there. Servo has three pin interface:
      <ol>
        <li>Brown: GND</li>
        <li>Red: 5V</li>
        <li>Orange: Signal Input</li>
      </ol>
