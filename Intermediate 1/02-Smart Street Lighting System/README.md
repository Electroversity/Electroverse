<h1>Smart Street Lighting System</h1>

<div>
    <p>This experiment is going to work on the principle that once the ambience turns dim/dark the LDR will sense that and will appropriately output a sensor value to the microcontroller. 
      The Arduino microcontroller will in-turn output a certain voltage to the base junctions so as to turn ON the BJTs.
      Once the transistors are ON the bulbs (which plays role of street lamps) will also turn on based on light intensity.

  Have Fun !</p>
